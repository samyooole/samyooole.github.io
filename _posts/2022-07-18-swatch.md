As a musician, finding the chords for a song is something I do *extremely* often. Whether I'm arranging for acappella or simply replicating the backbone of a pop song on the piano, knowing the chords of a song are crucial for capturing its essential colour - and provides a contextual springboard from which more musical fun can happen: reharmonizations, new melody lines, mashups, and more!

Most times, you'll be able to find the chords for the song you want online on a website like [Ultimate Guitar](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com). But these chords tend to come with a set of issues - maybe they are simplified, or they weren't transcribed accurately. Sometimes, there's a song that doesn't have any transcription at all because it's simply not well-known enough! 

In those moments, I wished there was a convenient tool to help me detect chords instantaneously. That is what spurred me to build **ùÑûwatch**, a Chrome extension that detects chords. It follows in the great tradition of lightweight Chrome extensions like [Colorzilla](https://www.colorzilla.com/chrome/) and [Transpose](https://transpose.video), both effective semi-automated tech solutions which automate away the non-essential, thereby allowing the user to exercise their expert judgement. I wanted my extension to be able to instantaneously capture the key of a song, just as Colorzilla could capture the hex code of a colour. I also wanted my extension to perform digital signal processing natively within Chrome, much like Transpose could perform key changes on music on the fly.

Introducing... **ùÑûwatch!**
