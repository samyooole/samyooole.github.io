In this app, I implement the savings algorithm first proposed by Clarke and Wright in the context of a delivery vehicle routing problem within a multi-level estate. You can randomly generate some number of customers who have each have a uniform requested delivery load. Importantly, customers occupy units, and units are connected to each other either by other units, or by nodes which do not have any occupancy. Floors are connected to each other by lifts, and lift edges are calibrated to a particular distance per floor. There is a single depot where deliveries are made from - this is the underground logistics hub. You can choose how many vehicles are at your disposal - interestly, the algorithm is sometimes able to find savings (that is, the total distance traveled across all robots is reduced) by reducing the number of vehicles, which makes sense especially if there are only few deliveries to be made, or if all the deliveries are clustered at one side of the estate. You can, however, insist that all vehicles be used. The objective in this problem is purely about total distance traveled by the robots in total, so there is no consideration of wait time experienced by customers. Once demand is generated, use the savings algorithm as a heuristic to find a good (but not necessarily optimal) allocation of vehicle routes for the deliveries to be made.
