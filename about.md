I graduated from Harvard University in 2024 with a Bachelor's degree in Economics, and am currently completing my Masters in Computer Engineering at Cornell Tech!

I develop in Javascript, Python, C/C++, C#, ROS2, SystemVerilog, WebAssembly, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Swift.

My skills include machine learning engineering, CUDA programming, multi-threading, low-level programming, robotics programming, 3D development, front-end development, ASIC design & verification.
